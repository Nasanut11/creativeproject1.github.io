# Creative Project One: The Paradise of an Arrakeen Inferno

## Summary of Work

For this Creative Project I am taking a version of the Markovifyed text for Exercise 1, that blended Milton's Paradise Lost and Dante's Inferno together, and then running Markovify again to blend a thrid text into that mix - Frank Herbert's Dune. Then using the GPT-2 code from Exercise 2 to create "odes" or poems, though largly similar to the small stories of the Prose Edda. From here, these small odes/stories will be formated as an output on this GitHub website.
