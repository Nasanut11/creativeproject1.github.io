# Creative Project One: The Paradise of an Arrakeen Inferno

## Summary of Work

For this Creative Project I am taking a version of the Markovifyed text for Exercise 1, that blended Milton's *Paradise Lost* and Dante's *Inferno (The Divine Comedy)* together, and then running Markovify again to blend a thrid text into that mix - Frank Herbert's *Dune*. Then using the GPT-2 code from Exercise 2 to create "odes" or poems, though largly similar to the small stories of the Prose Edda. From here, these small odes/stories will be formated as an output on this GitHub website.

## Instructions for Runnning

To run this program simply load the [Train_a_GPT_2_Text_Generating_Model_w_GPU.ipynb](Train_a_GPT_2_Text_Generating_Model_w_GPU.ipynb) into Google Colab. Once there, run all the cells as the directions state. When at the section **Uploading a Text File to be Trained to Colaboratory**, upload the file titled [DunesParadiseInferno2.txt](DunesParadiseInferno2.txt) from the Markovifyed folder. Once this is uploaded into your Google Drive through Colab, the remaining instructions can be followed on the GPT-2 page.

## Artist Statement

These outputs derive their inspiration directly from Frank Herbert's *Dune*, where the Princess Irulan has excerpts before each chapter from her diary. These excerpts are mostly prose and tell stories of Arrakis, the Padishah Emperor, and Paul/Muad'dib. The generated samples from this GPT-2 project each begin with "An ode to" in order to make each passage feel slightly somber or reminiscent in nature. The samples, of which contain 3414 words, are a blending of the three texts. Dune already has a religious aspect to its story, and by combining Milton's *Paradise Lost* and Dante's *Divine Comedy* the religiosity of these outputs is theoretically amplified. As usual with GPT-2 or generation of this type the final sentence is cut off from its ending. While this is not ideal, the meaning as a whole within these passages remains the same.
